        <h2>Lecture Series 2021</h2>

        <p align="justify"><b>The ambition of this lecture series</b> is to create a platform for ideas outside the common and settled "cognitive science culture” 
          and induce a progressive discussion on how to research the mind. With the presented talks, we want to make a start and thereby provide 
          an incentive to critically reflect upon the fundamental beliefs and approaches of cognitive science research in general. Today, we find 
          that cognitive science research is dominated by very few disciplines, many perspectives are disregarded and receive little to no attention. 
          As such, we want to integrate new, different and usually disregarded directions (such as climate change research, alternative epistemologies, 
          critical AI, and critical race theory) within the research field of cognitive science.</p>

              <br><br> <p align="justify">One of humans’ distinctive cognitive abilities is that they develop an array of capacities through an enculturation process. 
              In “Cognition as a Social Skill,” Sally Haslanger (2019) points to one of the dangers associated with enculturation: ideological oppression. 
              To conceptualize how such oppression takes root, Haslanager appeals to notions of mindshaping and social coordination, whereby people 
              participate in oppressive social practices unthinkingly or even willingly.Arguably, an appeal to mindshaping provides a new kind of argument, 
              grounded in philosophy of mind, which supports the claims that feminist and anti-racist want to defend. However, some theorists worry that 
              Haslanger’s account does not shed much light on how individuals could exert their agency to resist oppression. I argue that enactivist 
              conceptions of mindshaping and habit can help us to make sense of the power of social influences and how they have the potential to both 
              enable and undermine cognition and agency.This moves us toward increased understanding of the workings of social oppression—distinguishing 
              between (a) constructive and enabling forms of heteronomy, and (b) overdetermining and pernicious modes that lead to atrophied moral cognition 
              and a narrowing of the field of affordances.</p>
