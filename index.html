        <h2>Lecture Series 2021</h2>

        <p align="justify">The cognitive science research of today is dominated by specific disciplines and methods - especially neuroscience 
          and AI and an empirical approach and a computational paradigm respectively. Many other perspectives are disregarded and receive little 
          to no attention. <b>The ambition of this lecture series</b> is to create a platform for ideas outside the common and settled 
          "cognitive science culture” and to induce a progressive discussion on how to research the mind. We want to integrate new, different 
          and usually disregarded directions (such as alternative epistemologies, critical AI, and critical race theory) 
          within the research field of cognitive science. With the presented talks, we want to make a start and thereby provide an incentive to 
          critically reflect upon the fundamental beliefs and approaches of cognitive science research in general.</p>

              <br><br> <p align="justify">One of humans’ distinctive cognitive abilities is that they develop an array of capacities through an enculturation 
              process. In “Cognition as a Social Skill,” Sally Haslanger (2019) points to one of the dangers associated with enculturation: ideological oppression. 
              To conceptualize how such oppression takes root, Haslanager appeals to notions of mindshaping and social coordination, whereby people 
              participate in oppressive social practices unthinkingly or even willingly.Arguably, an appeal to mindshaping provides a new kind of argument, 
              grounded in philosophy of mind, which supports the claims that feminist and anti-racist want to defend. However, some theorists worry that 
              Haslanger’s account does not shed much light on how individuals could exert their agency to resist oppression. I argue that enactivist 
              conceptions of mindshaping and habit can help us to make sense of the power of social influences and how they have the potential to both 
              enable and undermine cognition and agency.This moves us toward increased understanding of the workings of social oppression—distinguishing 
              between (a) constructive and enabling forms of heteronomy, and (b) overdetermining and pernicious modes that lead to atrophied moral cognition 
              and a narrowing of the field of affordances.</p>

              <br><br> <p align="justify">An often-noted strength of cognitive theories of emotion is their ability to explain how particular emotional 
              responses can be criticized on rational grounds. If emotions are either identical toor closely associated with judgments about the world
              (e.g., that danger is imminent in the case of fear; or that one has been wronged in the case of resentment), then emotions can be subject 
              to rational criticism by showing that their implicit cognitive content implies something false. In such cases, we can say that the emotions 
              are criticized as inapt. This paper explores a second way that emotions can go wrong, namely, by contributing to the simultaneously epistemic 
              and ethical distortion of the agent’s normative outlook. Prolonged bouts of anger, jealousy, hatred, fear, and other emotions can go wrong not 
              only by implying particular false judgments about the world, but by contributing more generally to a pernicious picture of the world in which 
              one sees one’s existing biases and prejudicesconfirmed as incontrovertible. In this second sort of case, we can say that the emotions are 
              criticized not simply as inapt but as distorting. This paper argues that these two sides of emotionsgoing wrong should be understood in relation 
              to one another and defends a view called the articulation model of emotion that attempts to meet this challenge. According to the articulation 
              model, the cognitive work of emotions consists not only in making particular evaluative judgments, but also in the more fundamental activity 
              of stitching together a value-laden picture of the world in which those judgments can be formulable and intelligible in the first place. 
              In developing this view, I contrast it with other cognitive-evaluative views, like Martha Nussbaum’s,and focus primarily on the case of anger 
              and resentment. I conclude by considering some parallels between distorting emotions and the distorting effects of ideology.</p>
